# Hormonal_Determinants_On_Ventilation
R-based mixed-effects modeling project analyzing how hypoxia, hormones, and exercise intensity affect women’s ventilation. Built a full pipeline for imputation, VIF checks, interaction modeling (e.g., hypoxia×HRT), and visualization, delivering reproducible insights for a biomedical client.
